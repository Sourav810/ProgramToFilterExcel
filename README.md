Overview
This is a Python program designed to filter Excel files containing employee data based on specified conditions. 
It analyzes information such as employee names, positions, start times, and end times to provide valuable insights into work patterns. 
The program identifies employees who have worked for seven consecutive days, those with less than 10 hours between shifts (but more than one hour), and individuals who have logged over 14 hours in a single shift.
